Thank you for downloading VirtuaFlight.

VirtuaFlight is a lightweight free-open source application developped for Flight Simulator players. The purpose of this open-source freeware is to record on text files and display flight data parameters extracted from Flight Simulator.

The flight label parameters that you have choosen can then be recorded on your hardware on .txt files.

Moreover, you can play with Flight Simulator while displaying flight data to any Live streamings (Twitch for example).

This program can export flight data labels which can be placed into your Live stream. This program has also capability to present the vertical speed rate when landing and other cool features, like displaying the altitude and Radio Altimeter source below 1000 ft.

You will need to have previously installed FSUIPC to extract data from Flight Simulator. It is mandatory to have already installed at least the free version of FSUIPC. This free program can be downloaded at http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html.

if you wish to broadcast flight parameters while playing on Flight Simulator, then you could for example use VirtuaFlight to record flight parameters constantly. For example, OBS Studio is an excellent and open source free broadcasting suite which VirtuaFlight supports. OBS can be downloaded from https://www.obsproject.com
